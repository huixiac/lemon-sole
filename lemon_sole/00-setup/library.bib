abstract ={The Icelandic cod stock is analysed with respect to the probable effects of different harvesting strategies on yield, spawning stock biomass, and economic benefits. Simulations are used to investigate the probability of stock recovery and collapse. Potential yield and economic benefits/costs are also investigated, using stochastic and deterministic models. In stochastic simulations, attention is paid to the apparent stock–recruitment relationship, the highly variable weight-at-age and maturity-at-age in Icelandic waters along with the inevitable inaccuracies in current and future assessments. Regardless of method, substantial reduction in catches from recent (1993) levels is seen to be necessary in order to rebuild the stock. In the deterministic model, profit maximization mandates closure of the fishery until the stock is rehabilitated. Using the stochastic model, it is predicted that recent catch levels lead to eventual extinction of the stock with high probability. A management procedure is formulated and its application to the model is shown to lead to stabilization of the stock around an economically and biologically acceptable level.},

Ecosystem structure in the Iceland Sea and recent changes to the capelin (Mallotus villosus) population. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: .
The objective of the Iceland Sea Ecosystem Project was to analyse principal ecosystem patterns, including the life history of capelin. Ten surveys were conducted for this purpose between 2006 and 2008, and hydrographic data from 1970 to 2011 were analysed. Long-term temporal patterns indicate an increase in the temperature of surface and intermediate waters during recent years in the Iceland Sea. The phytoplankton consisted mainly of diatoms in spring, with flagellates and dinoflagellates appearing later in the year. Zooplankton and fish were dominated by a few species. In late summer, the pelagic foodweb ranged between trophic levels 2.4 and 3.6. Trends in nutrients and primary production showed a clear seasonal pattern with a spring bloom in late May, followed by a peak in secondary production in July/August. The spatial structure of the lower ecosystem levels in summer was stable across the 3 years, determined mainly by the structure of the water masses. The pelagic fish fauna consisted primarily of adult pelagic fish and transient numbers of larval species. The spatial pattern of capelin indicated northward displacement of 0-group capelin and westward displacement of older capelin in recent years. The annual biomass was estimated at 3.8 million tonnes of phytoplankton, ∼21 million tonnes of zooplankton, and 1.0 million tonnes of fish.},
